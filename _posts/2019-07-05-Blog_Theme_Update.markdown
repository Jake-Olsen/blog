Though I haven't made any changes live yet. I did get a theme working. I just had to follow the guide on the Github page for the theme.  
[Jekyll Hacker Blog Theme](https://github.com/tocttou/hacker-blog)

Then work through the errors to get Jekyll to work again. I just copied my posts over to the test site which came up with no issues. I also altered the about page, and 404 page to my liking. I'm sure I'll improve them in the future :)

After I get the extra links at the top altered along with the site's color theme. Hopefully I'll make it live on the internet on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
