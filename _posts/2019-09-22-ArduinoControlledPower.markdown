After having the cisco lab online for a bit, I didnâ€™t realize that it would more than double my power bill. Looking for a way to turn it off remotely and I got the idea from a colleague to make my own with Arduino and he helped put it together.

Next time I should take some progress pictures. 

Instead As a summary:
1. Unsoldered the switch
2. Used a multimeter to test which 2 sections of the board completes the circuit.
3. Soldered 2 wires to the internal board
4. Connect those to the relay board and attach both to the power strip.
5. wire up the Arduino to the relay and finish coding the Arduino. 

I wanted the circuit normally open since it will be off most of the time. Then the relay can close and complete the circuit when I remotely turn it on.


To turn it on I just open a new tab and go to http://ipAddress/$1

To turn it of I just open a new tab and go to http://ipAddress/$0

I'm not sure why a new tab has to be used and why text based browsers like Lynx or Curl don't work. I guess that is for a future update when I have time.

I did wait until the weekend to test it because I was paranoid that it would do something unexpected or catch on fire while I wasn't home.

<b>Update:</b> It has had no problems and has been stable and I've been using it for a few weeks now as of October 9th.
