Switched to PFSense.
Moved server to lower power and smaller box.
Got a local fiber internet provider and easily worked with them to get my router connected directly to their switch so I could avoid double NAT.
<br>(yes I actually got permission to plug into the switch where I have no gateway box in my apartment ðŸ™‚)


Connected the server and networking equipment 
Organized setup and semi cable managed it.

Don't have room for a rack so this will have to do for now.
