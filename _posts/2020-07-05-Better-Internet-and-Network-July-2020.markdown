When I moved into my new Apartment in February I also got new Internet. The only option in the apartment complex was AT&T. Though I got the AT&T Fiber 1000Mbps No Data Cap plan since it was only 20$ more a month than the 300Mbps plan that had a data cap. If I went over the Data Cap it would cost 20$ so I thought why not just skip that and get the Gigabit.

I couldn't push the Gigabit for awhile because I was still using my Ubiquiti EdgerouterX which can only do about 300Mbps with QoS Turned on. (Yes it can do around 1000Mbps with it off, but QoS still affects VoIP and Gaming even if your pipe doesn't have bottlenecks.)

I got new network equipment and setup around May 2020. Bought my own hardware and installed Untangle. The router is overkill for a home network. However I do plan to use a VPN again in the future when I'm out of the house. The hardware can push around 970Mbps with an encrypted OpenVPN setup.

I want to eventually do more, but I'm still sick at the moment. I would eventually like to rack everything and make it a cleaner setup as well as make it more secure. So I can practice better security practice on a regular basis. Even if it is a bit overkill for a home network. I think it would be a great learning experience.
