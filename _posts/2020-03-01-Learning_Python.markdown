Despite not feeling well and being very slow I'm still learning stuff, but it takes longer to do things than it usually would. 

I went through Microsoft's free python course.

I prefer using pycharm instead of VS Studio. I also made a small python program that would pull a list of domains from an excel document then attempt to resolve the IP Addresses. Then ping it to test if it was online and if it was successful it would put the results back into the excel file as a report.      

Unfortunately I lost the python file as I wasn't too good with organization and backups while going through Chemo, so you won't find it on GitHub. I do remember using Pandas to manipulate the excel files. Along with learning that using os.system in python isn't a great idea anymore since it is vulnerable.
