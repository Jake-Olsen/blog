Still working towards my CCENT / CCNA. The course I'm going through is on Udemy is a bit disorganized. However, it is a great value so it‚Äôs ok to deal with it. It is also better than what I got in my college course.

It is only really setup this way because Udemy limits the amount of content a course can have. The instructor was trying to provide as much content as possible. The content is split up into 5 different courses. Each one having a large copy of the others. You do get access to all of them when you buy the single course. The only problem is it then becomes very segmented.

I wanted to go up to the school to have a better study environment.  However, since I‚Äôm not enrolled there. I won‚Äôt have access to the computers or wi-fi. So, I found a cheaper mobile data plan. This way I can study at work, school, or anywhere that I have some spare time.

Also, I had some credit card debt from a couple of things I had to go through last year.  
**I finally finished paying it off!** üòÅ
