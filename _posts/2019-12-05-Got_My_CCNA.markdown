I finally finished studying, passed the test on December 3rd and the certification was verified the next day.
I got this cool badge the next day that verifies that you have the certification. [My Acclaim CCNA Badge]

For learning my way through ICND 1 & 2. I used David Bombal's Udemy Course, CBT Nuggets, Physical Hardware Lab, and multiple colleages that assisted me along the way. I also used the "CCNA in 60 Days" Book and Practice Tests, but I only really recommend them as supplementary content.

I am so glad to finally be done. In the future I'll probably study the new CCNA topics since they drastically changed it.
