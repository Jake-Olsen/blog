Finally getting back around to updating the blog as I'll finally be looking for the next step in my career despite not being fully healed yet.

One thing that has greatly helped in the big overhaul is learning that in chrome based web browsers.
If you open up the development console (F12) and put
document.designMode = 'on';
in the console. You can now freely copy paste, edit, ect. Which makes it much easier to edit.


Some of the major fixes and changes in this update are:
* Fixing spelling mistakes
* Adding in updates on old posts as I've found newer / better alternatives that work for me. 
* Changing some of the layout, colors.
* Code has been cleaned up, indented more correctly for easier editing in the future.
* Large amounts of content and posts have been updated and added.
* Some content such as pictures has been replaced with a more simple list. For example the youtube and podcast list in resources would be too much effort to fully format and update since there is no easy way to display it and no current method known to update it dynamically without some overly complicated widget.
