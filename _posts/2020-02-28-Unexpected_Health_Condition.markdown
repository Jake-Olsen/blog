I try to keep this blog professional as much as possible without going into personal issues. However since it is a portfolio I thought I'd share some insight into why I've slowed down in my learning projects. Along with why I didn't update anything for 2 years.

Got sick with a disease around end of 2019 where my Immune System was attacking my kidneys.  
Got admitted into the hospital in February for 4 days.  
Moved to a new apartment after getting out of the hospital.  
Covid-19 started to rapidly spread in the United States.  
In March I got a Chemo like treatments at the hospital to weaken my immune system so I can slowly start to get better.  
Luckily I didn't catch covid during treatments. It would have been really bad while having a compromised immune systems.    
I'm slow mentally and physically due to my body not absorbing nutrition.  
The best estimates for recovery were September 2020, then the immune system would be recovered in March.    

However that didn't work and I continued to receive additional treatments and multiple visits to the hospital sometimes lasting 5 days in a row until November 2021.

I was overall learning multiple subjects I generally focused on Linux & Security in 2018, Networking in 2019, Programming, and Servers in 2020.    

I have yet to use any of my newly found skills and knowledge at work. Honestly at work I'm completely bored. I'm not even close to working on anything technically challenging or any project oriented work. As I've been siloed to answering phones and tickets.  I am not allowed to improve anything even if it prevents hours upon hours of future issues. The company still has technicians band-aiding the same issues that we have had since I got hired in 2016 rather than permanently fixing it. I plan on going  to a different company for multiple reasons, but mostly because I feel like I'm going backwards in my career.  Though I'll put the career on hold until my health recovers. In the meantime I'll try to keep learning.
