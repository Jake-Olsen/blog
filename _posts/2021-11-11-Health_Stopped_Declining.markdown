November 2021 Update:

I try to keep this blog professional as much as possible without going into personal issues. However since it is a portfolio I thought I'd share some insight into why I've slowed down in my learning projects. Along with why I didn't update anything for 2 years.

Since March 2020 I went through 3 different treatments, had leg infections due to the lowered immune system, low hemoglobin and low oxygen levels in cells. Due to the low O2 my heartrate would be at 146 sitting at a desk. I was exhausted. Along with lots of other issues related to the condition as well. However in Mid August 2021 the PLA2R Anti-Body test that is an indicator for my condition was finally un-detectable. I've been slowly doing better with the last few months. Then in the beginning of November I went to a nearby state for a doctor appointment to speak with a doctor that specializes with this condition to get their ideas just in-case the condition comes backs because at this point we are all out of ideas if I do relapse. Along with learning more about my condition based on their expertise.
