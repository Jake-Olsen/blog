These first few posts won't really be dated well. I started to create a blog in my spare time. It is going to take a bit trying to get a website in my free time while still learning the CCNA. Mostly focusing on the CCNA until I need to break the routine.

I've decided to try to create the blog with Jekyll on GitHub Pages as it won't have the obnoxious code and/or malicious ads like other free sites I've tried.

I don't have much experience making a website other than the one class in high school. Too bad the advanced class at my high school was canceled due to not enough enrollment.

I also updated the URL to now be more simple
[https://jake-olsen.github.io/blog/]

Step 1 is complete ðŸ™‚
