The Security Firm "Huntress Labs" did a great writeup on how they found malware that was hiding in plain sight.

One thing I found that was very interesting is how you can manipulate numbers by converting them between different formats.  
For example you can ping 0xC0A80101 and it will resolve to 192.168.1.1  
or ping 3232235777 and it will resolve to 192.168.1.1
